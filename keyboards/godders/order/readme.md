# Order

A 5-row ortholinear keyboard compatible with cases for CFT's Discipline
keyboard (eg Protozoa's P.02 case).

## Features

 * MX Hotswap
 * 1u or 2u thumb keys
 * Support for up to three encoders (although several choices of location)
 * USB-C, with a (hopefully) easy to solder socket.
 * Experimental OLED support
 * Stupid name

## Influences

Basically, between ordering and receiving my P.02 case I learned
to type on an ortholinear keyboard.

## Flashing

This supports the same modified USBASP bootloader that CFTKB's
Discipline and Mysterium use (the difference being that the USB
pins are more sensibly located for an ATMega32A).
